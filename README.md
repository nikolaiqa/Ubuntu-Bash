# About
Here I'm introducing my skills with standard commands in the terminal. Each task in the repository involves both a condition and a solution. Every solution of the task is a GIF-file so you may see with ease how I manage usual things like creating, moving, deleting folders and files in dynamic way. Also there're PNG-files in the tasks representing a full solution at once. A "Sourses" folder stores all the used in this repository files.
